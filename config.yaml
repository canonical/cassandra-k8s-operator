      Amount of memory to set to the Cassandra's JVM heap.
      Used for both minimum and maximum heap size (`-Xms` and `-Xmx` respectively).
      Valid values are formed by an integer, followed by one of the following memory units:
      `k` (Kylobytes), `m` (megabytes), `g` (gigabytes).
      Memory units can also be capitalized as `K`, `M`, `G`.
      Notice that, since the numerical value of the setting must be an integer,
      using `-Xmx512m` is valid, but `-Xmx0.5g` will cause an error.
